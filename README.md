I used the basic layout of the grid from class on 3/11 to make up the wireframe suggested in github from RogerHuba.

## Lab 11 Lighthouse Accessibility Score:

This app was produced to provied a survey to employees at Odd Duck Products so that company leadership can have input as to which products should take priority in their production pipeline.  Images of various products nominated by management are presented to the users, with no image repeating in two rounds in a row.  The user votes for which product they prefer by clicking on the images presented in that app.  The number of votes and number of views for each product are presented in a bar graph at the bottom of the page upon request.

*My daughter came by while I was working on this page and said the colors could use some work.  So I let her choose a color palette and she picked [this one](https://coolors.co/palette/9b5de5-f15bb5-fee440-00bbf9-00f5d4) but told me not to use 00F5D4 because she doesn't like it.  And then she said I needed SPARKLES!!*

*So a special thanks to [Anna Lytical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZaqhK98Aeg) for a really easy tutorial that made me look cool in front of my daughter!*
